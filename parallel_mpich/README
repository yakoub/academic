program developed using mpich2

compile using make command ,output is file: cluster 
makefile uses mpicc that is installed by mpich2

run cluster using : mpiexec -n {NUM_OF_CLUSTER+1} cluster
mpiexec is installed by mpich2

program main operation can be seen clearly in cluster.c
it run monitor program + several clusters

monitor will read input file "targets.txt" and 
run scatter function to partition targets and
assign each partition to a cluster program .
you can view output of partition algorithm
using seq/scatter.c program and gui/vw
monitor uses sequential operation to partition , 
then sends targets and edges to the assigned 
cluster using MPI_Send , MPI_Recv
monitor proceeds to monitor cluster activity
and is responsible for announcing termination 
to all clusters , also it holds the final solution
and outputs it partly to file "solution.txt" 
and partly to stdout

stalkers are divided equally between clusters at
start of algorithm , so each cluster will
spawn several stalkers as threads using pthread functions ,
stalker related functions is at stalker.c .
in adition to spawning stalkers , the starting thread
continues to run mpi_inbox which is at mpi_inbox.c .
each stalker uses cluster local targets structure
-which is defined in cluster.h- to construct its path .
at each point a stalker needs to choose next target ,
and it does that using sorted distances and number 
of samples of each target and avergae samples of all targets .
sorted distances aims to optemize total sampling ,
while average samples aims to optemize each target samples .
the macro value on stalker.c AVRG_FACTOR will affect
the ratio between those two goals.

mpi_inbox handles main mpi operations which consist
of stalker requesting samples of target from another cluster
and stalker passing to target belonging to another cluster .
when a stalker decide to pass cluster it sends its current 
trail to monitor
see cluster.h for list of mpi call tags

when all stalkers stop monitor will output solution
use program under gui directory to view solution , read gui/README

input files targets.txt must have number of targets 
and number of stalkers and time period at first line , then target 
coordinats each at a new line .
