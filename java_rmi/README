<Running>
---------
1)start rmiregistery

2)deploy Ass4.war at tomcat server .
edit web.xml to and enter rmiIP value .(default is localhost )

3)
use StartClusters.java to start Clusters but first
edit initfile.txt for entering rmiregistery URL

4)browse the site at /Ass4/index.html

<Design>
---------
RecommenderSystem class is the web servelet that service
Active users Recomendation html requests 

the class init method uses a remoteHook object
to wait for all clusters to register at rmiregistry as rmi servers.
it registers the remoteHook object at rmiregistry
so that a Cluster uses rmi to get refference to remotwHook
and notify the servelet of its registration


<remote Objects>
----------------
[remoteHook]
	implements remote interface HookInterface
	remoteHook is used to initielize the system so that clusters
	would notify the system of there existence

[RequestImpl]
	implements remote interface Request
	the RequestImpl is created in the system and 
	registered at as an rmi server so that clusters
	can get the Request info .
	the system use Request method notFinished to block
	untill the Request is finished.
	each Cluster that finished registers its candidate
	at the Request using te interface's method which
	inturn notify the system of the registration

[SuperUser] 
	implmenets remote interface Cluster
	the Cluster is an rmi server .
	StartClusters class main method creats Clusters
	according to HookInterface that is created by System.
	RecomenderSystem has an array of refferences to Clusters
	that is intielized after remoteObject notify about 
	the registration of all the Clusters at rmi daemon

--------------
all Clusters and other remote objects are registered at 
the same rmi daemon , inorder to use different rmi daemon URLs
all remote objects needs to pass to the system the URL
using HookInterface , but this was not imlemented .
